                                    <p class="infoBio-text" id="thotBio">Brando is a current IRA member who uses their vast network and alliances with other anti-government organizations to gather information. He first came into notoriety during the Great Christmas Banning of 2016, where he made use of a weaponized PNG to suicide-bomb the shitpost channel in Track44. For the following two years, he organized and executed insurgent invasions of Track44 with the use of fake accounts and the same weaponized PNG, known as "burning_gays.png".<br><br>
                                        During this same time period, he also coordinated a devastating attack against the Tranny Army, a subgroup of Track44. In this attack, he targeted a specific member of their Army who had recently suffered the loss of their pet dog with a psychological attack by posting and immense amount of dead dog images in the chat. During this same time, he also executed a psychological operation on TSmalls, wherein he was bullied for knocking a child out at a Starbucks because he didn't like anime. This led to TSmalls going AWOL, and he has not been seen or heard from since. <br><br>
                                        The next notable events he was involved in were the Sunny Whistleblowing incidents of 2020 & 2021. During these incidents, it was revealed the Sunny was dressing up in cow outfits and getting pegged by a vtuber. Following this, in 2021, it was revealed by an unknown benefactor that he was also involved in sexual acts such as getting pissed on; the fallout from this revelation would lead to another psychological attack by Brando that would case Sunny to retreat from the Cunny Zone.<br><br>
                                        A notable figure throughout Brando's story is his father, known only as "Beamish" and "Beamo". He is a suspected drug dealer working within the Irish government to further the goals of the IRA; however, very little is known about him. <br>
